    <h1>About Coca Cola</h1>
    <p>
        It was 1886, John Pemberton, an Atlanta pharmacist, was inspired by simple curiosity. 
        One afternoon, he stirred up a fragrant, caramel-coloured liquid and, when it was done, 
        the mixture was combined with carbonated water and sampled by customers who all agreed - 
        this new drink was something special!
